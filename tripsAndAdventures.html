        <p>Though these trips and adventures may be sparce, they are important to us because it's time that we are together. <br><br> Adventures with us are interesting, there is times of peace and times of fighting, but always, is there time for eachother.</p>

      <h5>San Fransisco</h5>
      <p>In July we took a trip to San Fransisco, The flight to California was split as we tried to use the flight benefit I had while working for United Airlines.
        sadly, Dad stayed behind because there weren't enough seats for all of us. Once we landed, Mom and the kids got the rental car, and it took almost as much time
        as it took for Dad to fly and meet us. we rented a 2022 Nissan Pathfinder, the car was so fancy to us, coming from the beatup Caravan that we have, it was like being
        in a space ship. There were so many buttons and switches, even the shifter was forign and confusing to operate, Holly couldn't figure out how to put it in reverse.
        Once we were all together again, we went to the hotel, to plan the rest of the day. We stayed at a Mariot Suites hotel in San Mateo. The beds were comfy, they provided a
        pack and play for Ryker, Trev had his own space to sleep, while Holly and Maiya shared a bed, DJ and Travis shared the other, Ryker had the play yard in the bedroom section.
        We decided to go to Fishermans wharf. It was really cold!!! We had dinner at a different hotel, and went back to our own. The next day, we got up and drove to the beach
        where we spent most of the day. After that, it was time to go back to the airport and return to our real home in Colorado. From this trip, we learned that we all want to fly
        together more, and eventually, go back to San Fransisco for a longer period of time.</p>
        <p>Here are a few pictures that we got while in San Fransisco!</p><br>

      <h3>Camping Trips</h3>
      <h5>Cherry Creek State Park</h5>
      <p>Our first camping trip together was a one night stay at Cherry Creek State Park for one night. We did this as a test to see how a multi-night camping trip would be for us.
        Once we got the tent set up, we decided to make a fire. This was our first real challenge, because we forgot a lighter. We attempted to light the fire with magnesium and a
        flint and stone. It failed, Fortunately, we weren't too far from home so Dad and Travis went home to get a lighter and a few other odds and ends that we forgot.
        Once they came back, we started to make dinner. We took chili and made it over a camp fire. While we were eating, the bugs decided it was time to come out and play. We relocated
        into a screen tent to finish dinner. Soon after, it was time for us to go to bed, at first, it wasn't too bad. But, towards the end of the night, close to sunrise, it got really
        cold. So cold that everyone was complaining, especially Ryker. Ryker wouldnt stay in his blankets to keep warm. We then realized that we were going to need a tent heater for his
        safety.<br>

      <h5>Granby Lake</h5>
      <p>Our second camping trip that same year was to Granby Lake, CO. This trip was scheduled for three days and two nights. I say that because, we only made it one night. Ryker was still
        having trouble sleeping under a blanket or staying in a sleeping bag. We were able to set up faster, and didn't forget as much this time, but we didn't have something important, access
        to water. The website for the camp ground stated that they had water access points, but they didn't mention that they didn't work. We weren't too far from town, so Holly and DJ
        went to get a few gallons of water. Once properly supplied, the rest of the trip went much better. We went for a hike, played a few games, sat and relaxed and watched the stars that evening.
        While we were watching the stars, Ryker fell asleep on DJ while relaxing in a hammock. The next morning, we made breakfast, and attempted to go for a backwoods hike, and made it about
        a short distance, and realized that there were too many trees knocked down for the littles to make it along the path we tried for. That afternoon, we decided as a whole that we were all
        ready to go home.

        <h5>Chambers Lake</h5>
      <p>This was by far, the easiest of the three. We scheduled for 3 days and 2 nights, again. This time we all agreed that we were going to stay for the full amount of time. This time we did stay.
        We made the drive to Chambers Lake, CO. Once there we set up and made dinner. After eating burgers, we sat as a group and talked about nature, going fishing in our canoes, and what we were
        going to do the next day. Trev decided that he didn't want to go canoeing as he was tired from not sleeping the night before camping, so Holly, DJ, Travis, Maiya and Ryker all went on the lake.
        Getting to the waters edge was really hard, it was muddy and sloppy because the lake was dried down for the season. Once again with the sleeping problems. Ryker needs to learn to
        stay under blankets. Even with the tent heater, he was a frozen little guy. The camp site we had was pretty neat, there were a bunch of paths that were made by previous campers around the area,
        a few cairn's made by people before us. The littles (Maimai and Ryker) had plenty of space to run around and burn energy.

      <h3>Day Trips</h3>
      <h5>Georgetown and Clear Lake</h5>
      <p>Georgetown and Clear Lake are close enough to each other to make them the same day trip, Not to mention that we usually stop off at a local restraunt called Pick Axe Pizza. Clear lake is a nice quiet place 
        to spend a day fishing, or paddling around the lake in a canoe. The water is clear, and the fish are well stocked. Just make sure you have your fishing licence with you. This is the lake that my older two caught
        their first fish. We tried to bring them home to cook them, but we didn't have a container...or ice. Georgetown is a historic mining town that was established in 1859, and is the home of the Silverplume mining tour.
        The mine tour can be reached by narrow gauge rail, and then explored with a group. Be warry, if you are taller than 5'4", your going to hit your helmet...a lot.

      <h5>New Mexico</h5>
      <p>We decided to randomly drive to New Mexico for a day trip. We had just recently purchased a new car, and wanted to see how it handled a road trip. We drove from Aurora, Colorado to Raton, NM. Stopped for food
        then made the trip home. It was fun, and the kids had the opportunity to see a small portion of a new state. 3 down, 47 to go! for most of the kiddos.

      <h5>Dillon</h5><p>This was another random day trip. We had originally planned to stop in Georgetown, but decided to keep driving and ended up in Dillon, CO. The reservoir is one of the larger man made lakes in 
        colorado, and was a spot my family would go camping when I was a kid. We had fun, Travis caught his first fish here.
