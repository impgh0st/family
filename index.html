    <h2><span>About Us</span></h2>
    <p>Holly and I got married on March 18, 2004. We moved to Fort Polk, LA while I was enlisted. During the time that we
      were in there, We gave birth to our first child in 2005. I was medically discharged one year later, and we moved
      back home to Colorado. Since we moved home, we gave birth to three more kiddos in 2007, 2017 and 2018. Together as
      a family we have had a few fun adventures, found a variety of TV shows and movies to enjoy together and games to
      play on xbox, and at the table. Through this blog, we are going to highlight some of those adventures and
      activities for everyone to see.</p>
